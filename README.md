# SaveTabs
A Chrome extension for saving tabs.

It's not available on Chrome Web Store, because it was just a personal project initially made to be able to store all of the open tabs and reload them later, but then I expanded on it.

## How to use
1. Open chrome extensions page (chrome://extensions/)
2. Ensure that the "Developer mode" checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.
3. Select "Load unpacked".
4. Select the folder which contains the extension.
